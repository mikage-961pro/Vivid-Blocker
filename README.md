## Introduction
Letâ€™s be honest: We see a lot of advertising every day in our daily life. On average, we see 5,000 ads per day, and if you think that is too much, try to think of the last time you saw an ad. It was probably five minutes ago.
Nowadays ads are everywhere: City cardboards, LED maxi screens, newspapers, radios, the internet, and mobile apps are just some of the main ways advertisers reach consumers.
In order to mitigate this problem (at least on Safari), in iOS 9, Apple added the possibility to use a content blocker.
